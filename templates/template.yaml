term: Characterization of *cyclic groups generated* by an element $a\in G$ in terms of subgroups.
alias: Theorem 3.1
description: |
   Let $G$ be a group and $a\in G$. Then the set $$\langle a\rangle=\set{a^k:k\in\Z}$$ is a subgroup of $G$. Futhermore, $\langle a\rangle$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $a$.

description: |
  A subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following conditions.
listStyle: roman bracket
list:
  - The identity $e$ of $G$ is in $H$.
  - If $h_1,h_2\in H$, then $h_1h_2\in H$
  - If $h \in H$, then $h\inv\in H$
