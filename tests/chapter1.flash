term: Properties of a <b>power series</b>
description: |
  A <b>power series</b> $\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(z-a)^n$ satisfies exactly one of the following:
list:
  - the series converges $\forall z\in \C$
  - the series converges only for $z=a$
  - |
    there exists a positive $R\in\R$ such that the series converges $\forall z\in \C:|z-a|\lt R$ and diverges $\forall z\in\C : |z-a|\gt R$

description: |
  Let $D=N(c,R)$ be an open disc in $\mathbb{C}$. Let $f$ be a complex function whose domain contains $D$, let $\\f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$, and supppose that the partial derivatives $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial v}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$$ exist and are continuous throught $D$. Suppose also that the Cauchy Rieman equations are satisfied at $c$. Then $f$ is differentiable at $c$.

  Hello <b>this is a</b> slightly longer term, so I can test something using it.

description: |
  Let $S$ be a closed, bounded set, and $f$, with domain containing $\delta$, be continuous. Then $f$ is bounded on $S$; that is $\{|f(z)|:z\in S\}$ is bounded. Moreover if $M=\sup_\delta|f|$, then $\exist z\in S$ such that $|f(z)|=M$.
